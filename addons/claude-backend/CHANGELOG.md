# Changelog

## 4.3.2 — Fix chat UI completely broken (send + sidebar)
- **Root cause**: bare `\n` (Python newline) inside a JS regex character class in `_stripCodeBlocks()` was inserted as a literal newline in the generated HTML, splitting the regex across two lines and causing a `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: missing /`
- **Impact**: the syntax error prevented the entire `<script>` block from executing — send button, conversation sidebar, and all JS features stopped working
- **Fix**: replaced `\n` with `\\n` in the regex `/`[^`\n]+`/g` so it produces the correct JS regex `/`[^`\n]+`/g`
- **validate.sh**: added check for bare `\n` inside JS regex character classes in `chat_ui.py` source

## 4.3.1 — Split-view file explorer
- **New sidebar tab "Files"** (📁): browse `/config` directory tree directly from the chat UI — shows dirs and files with icons, size, and breadcrumb navigation
- **File preview panel**: clicking a file opens a resizable middle panel (default 320px, drag splitter to resize, min 180px / max 600px) with tabbed view — up to 3 files open at once
- **YAML syntax highlight**: key–value pairs, strings, booleans, numbers, and comments are colour-coded without any external library
- **File context injection**: open files are automatically prepended to the AI payload as `[FILE: path]\ncontent\n[/FILE]` blocks — context bar above the input shows which files are active
- **Context bar stripping**: `[FILE:...]` blocks never appear in the chat history visible to the user (stripped by `stripContextInjections`)
- **New REST endpoints**: `GET /api/files/list?path=` and `GET /api/files/read?file=` — path-traversal protection, 15 000-char read limit with truncation notice
- **Responsive**: file panel and its splitter are hidden on mobile (`max-width: 599px`) — the tab still shows the tree for reference
- **Dark-mode** styles for all new elements

## 4.3.0 — Four bug fixes: Copilot tool round 2, bubble thinking label, log quick actions i18n, chatgpt_web warning
- **GitHub Copilot HTTP 400 on tool round 2**: after `flatten_tool_messages()` the conversation ended with an `assistant` turn (tool result merged in), which Copilot rejects — now injects a `user` continuation prompt when the last message is an assistant turn
- **`flatten_tool_messages` null content fix**: assistant messages with `content: None` now get a non-null placeholder so strict providers don't reject with 400
- **Tool result missing `name` field**: `role=tool` messages now include `"name": fn_name` so flatten produces `[TOOL RESULT: get_automations]` instead of `[TOOL RESULT: ]`
- **Bubble thinking label shows model name**: thinking indicator now shows active model — e.g. "Sto pensando · gpt-4o... (3s)" — using `agentData.current_model_technical`
- **Log quick actions in wrong language**: `getQuickActions()` was sending hardcoded English text to AI regardless of UI language — added `qa_*_text` i18n keys for all 4 languages (IT/EN/ES/FR)
- **chatgpt_web `curl_cffi` warning suppressed**: downgraded from `WARNING` to `DEBUG` since provider is hidden from UI

## 4.2.9 — GitHub Copilot: full model list + updated API headers
- **Static model list extended**: GitHub Copilot provider now shows 30+ known models immediately, even before authentication — includes Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku 4.x, GPT-5.x-codex, GPT-5.1/5.2, Gemini 3.x, Grok Code Fast, and all GPT-4o/4.1 variants
- **Updated API headers**: all Copilot HTTP calls (session token, /models, chat) now use `copilot-chat/0.26.7` and `vscode/1.100.0` (was `0.12.2` / `1.85.0`) — matches current Copilot extension version for full model access
- **Refresh button** (`Aggiorna modelli`) calls `GET /models` on `api.githubcopilot.com` and replaces the static list with the live models available on the user's subscription
- **Legacy display name mappings** updated in `api.py` to include all new Claude/Gemini/Grok/GPT-5 model names
- Reasoning/special models (`o1`, `o3`, `oswe-*`) excluded from `temperature`/`top_p` to avoid API errors

## 4.2.8 — Bubble: fix log dialog closed by bubble button click
- **Root cause**: HA dialogs close when clicking outside them; the bubble button is "outside" → clicking bubble always dismissed the open log popup before context could be captured
- **`mousedown` pre-capture**: bubble button now captures `extractVisibleLogEntry()` on `mousedown` (fires before HA's document-level click handler closes the dialog), storing it in `_cachedLogEntry`
- **Persistent log cache `_cachedLogEntry`**: survives dialog close — updated whenever a live entry is detected (1s poll or `mousedown`), never cleared just because the dialog was dismissed
- **Fallback in `buildContextPrefix()`**: uses `ctx.logEntry || _cachedLogEntry` so AI sees the log entry even after the dialog is gone
- **Fallback in `getQuickActions()`**: "Spiega questo errore" / "Come si risolve?" chips appear using cached entry
- **Fallback in `updateContextBar()`**: shows "• log selezionato" indicator using cached entry
- Cache cleared on: navigation away from logs page, or "Nuova chat" button

## 4.2.7 — Bubble: HA log page context-awareness + get_ha_logs tool
- **Bubble detects `/config/logs` page**: shows "Log di sistema" in context bar, pulse animation on bubble
- **Log entry extraction**: walks HA shadow DOM to find open log dialog text; if found, context bar shows "• log aperto" and quick actions are tailored to that specific entry
- **Quick actions on log page**: "Spiega questo errore", "Come si risolve?", "Mostra tutti gli errori", "Problemi critici"
- **Live re-detection**: poll every 1s checks if a log dialog was opened/closed (URL doesn't change in HA) and refreshes context bar + quick actions
- **New tool `get_ha_logs`**: fetches `/api/error_log` from HA, filters by level (error/warning/info/all) and optional keyword, returns up to 200 entries
- **New endpoint `/api/ha_logs`**: server-side proxy to HA error_log (used by bubble for direct log fetching)
- **System prompt** updated: AI can now call `get_ha_logs` to fetch and diagnose HA errors

## 4.2.6 — Fix dashboard HTML edit via bubble with no-tool providers (openai_codex)
- Fixed synthetic assistant turn injected between dashboard HTML context and user request:
  changed "Dimmi cosa vuoi modificare" → "Procedo con la modifica richiesta" to prevent
  the AI from repeating the waiting message instead of executing the edit
- Added explicit HTML-output instruction to `api_content` for no-tool providers even when
  there is no smart context, so the model always knows to return full HTML not conversational text

## 4.2.5 — Bubble: real-time step progress matching chat UI
- Bubble now shows tool step bullets and status updates in real time during elaboration (same as chat UI)
- Tool badges (colored chips) appear for `🔧` status events — shows which HA tools are being called
- Fixed `_updateThinkingBase`: now reliably preserves all step bullets when updating the status line
- Increased max visible steps from 4 → 6 in the thinking bubble
- Fixed SSE buffer drain on stream close: leftover data in buffer is processed before breaking
- Guaranteed cleanup after stream end: `_removeThinking()` and `assistantEl.style.display=''`  always called even if server closes without a `done` event

## 4.2.4 — Fix dropdown reset on hover while browsing options
- `loadModels()` no longer rebuilds the DOM while a `<select>` is open
- Added `_selectOpen` flag: set to `true` on `mousedown`/`focus`, cleared on `blur`/`change`/`Escape`/`Tab`
- Both `providerSelect` and `modelSelect` tracked: prevents poll (every 10s) and post-`changeModel` reload from closing the dropdown and jumping back to the previous selection while the user is scrolling through options

## 4.2.3 — Fix SyntaxError in two-level AI selector
- Fixed `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\s'` in `chat_ui.py` that caused a `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal` at startup
- `\s` inside JS regex embedded in Python f-string was mis-interpreted as a Python escape sequence; changed to `\\s`
- Removed orphaned duplicate code block that appeared after `</html>"""` closing delimiter due to a botched previous edit

## 4.2.2 — Two-level AI selector: provider first, then model
- Header now shows two separate dropdowns instead of one grouped dropdown
- First select: choose provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, GitHub Copilot…)
- Second select: choose model for that provider (auto-populated on provider change)
- Switching provider auto-selects and applies the first model of that provider
- Responsive: stacked full-width on mobile, compact side-by-side on tablet/desktop

## 4.2.1 — Fix Ollama HTTP 400 "can't find closing '}' symbol"
- `providers/ollama.py`: Ollama's template engine (Go `text/template`) interprets literal `{` / `}` in message content and tool descriptions as template actions, causing 400 errors when smart context includes JSON entity data
- Added `_escape_braces()`: inserts a zero-width space after `{` and before `}` to break template patterns without affecting visible text
- Added `_sanitize_messages()` / `_sanitize_tool_schemas()`: deep-sanitise all text content before sending to Ollama
- Added fallback: if Ollama still fails with tool schemas, automatically retry without tools
- Fixed missing `_prepare_messages()` call (system prompt was not injected for Ollama)
- Extracted HTTP streaming into `_ollama_stream()` for cleaner retry logic

## 4.2.0 — Entity discovery: use real HA device_class instead of keyword matching
**Breaking change in entity matching logic — eliminates false positives entirely.**

### Problem
Previous approach used keyword/substring matching on entity_ids to find entities (e.g. searching for "battery" by matching "bat" inside entity names). This caused false positives: "bat" matched "sabato", pulling in unrelated consumption entities. Every new device_class would require a new keyword dictionary — fragile and unscalable.

### Solution
- `intent.py`: **Two-mode entity discovery:**
  - **Device-class mode** (battery, temperature, humidity, etc.): filters ONLY by the REAL `device_class` attribute from Home Assistant state — zero false positives, no substring matching needed
  - **Keyword mode** (fallback): for brands, room names, or custom terms that have no device_class mapping — still searches entity_id/friendly_name
- `intent.py`: removed `_keyword_synonyms` dictionary entirely — no longer needed since device_class filtering doesn't require synonym expansion
- `intent.py`: expanded `_device_class_aliases` to cover both IT and EN terms (batterie, battery, temperatura, temperature, etc.)
- `tools.py`: `_inject_entity_filter_fallback()` simplified — trusts the backend entity list as authoritative, removed all `_dc_keywords` dictionaries and keyword-based re-filtering

### Result
Works for any device_class (battery, temperature, motion, humidity, etc.) without maintaining keyword vocabularies. New device types work automatically.

## 4.1.14 — Fix iOS Companion App infinite loading + dashboard showing only 5 sensors
- `_fix_auth_redirect()`: entry-point regex now uses **prefix matching** (`load\w*` catches `loadBatteries()`, `loadSensors()`, etc.) — previously only matched exact names like `load()`, so `tok` stayed empty on iOS
- `_fix_auth_redirect()`: also wraps `setInterval`/`setTimeout` referencing entry-point functions in `_getTokenAsync().then(...)`
- New `_inject_entity_filter_fallback()` post-processor: when AI HTML filters `/api/states` by `device_class` (e.g. `=== 'battery'`), injects the backend's pre-filtered entity list as `window._HA_ENTITIES` and extends the filter to include all matching entities
- Dashboard creation pipeline now calls `_inject_entity_filter_fallback()` after auth redirect fix

## 4.1.13 — Fix AI using device_class filter instead of pre-loaded entity list
- `intent.py`: add `device_class` field to entity objects injected in smart context (was missing — AI couldn't see it)
- `tools.py`: tool description now explicitly instructs AI to copy entity_ids from ## ENTITÀ TROVATE and use `__ENTITIES_JSON__`, never filter `/api/states` by `device_class`
- System prompts updated with same instruction

## 4.1.12 — Rewrite auth patch: fix stale headers + entry-point wrapping
- `_fix_auth_redirect()` completely rewritten to operate per `<script>` block
- Also removes stale `const headers = {Authorization: 'Bearer '+tok}` built before token resolved
- Wraps bare `load()` / `init()` / `render()` calls in `_getTokenAsync().then(...)` at statement level
- Injects `_authHeader()` helper for consistent auth headers in all fetch calls

## 4.1.11 — Fix AI-generated auth redirect breaking Companion App
- Added `_fix_auth_redirect()` post-processor applied to all generated HTML dashboards
- Removes `if(!tok){ location.href='/?redirect=...' }` pattern that caused infinite loading in Companion App
- Replaces sync `localStorage.getItem('hassTokens')` token read with async `_getTokenAsync()` — tries parent iframe postMessage first, then localStorage
- Injects initial states snapshot (`__INITIAL_STATES_JSON__`) so page renders immediately without client-side auth

## 4.1.10 — Fix HTML dashboard auth in Companion App
- `getTokenAsync()` now tries `postMessage` to parent window first (correct channel when page is inside a Lovelace iframe in Companion App)
- Token cached after first resolution to avoid repeated async lookups
- Fetch proceeds even without token (HA session-cookie fallback)

## 4.1.9 — Authoritative entity fallback from smart context
- `intent.py` saves pre-loaded entity_ids to `api._last_smart_context_entity_ids`
- `tools.py` uses those as last-resort fallback when AI passes only JS garbage in `entities[]` and HTML scan finds nothing

## 4.1.8 — Entity pre-filter via HA domain whitelist + HTML fallback extraction
- Replace regex pre-filter with HA domain whitelist (`sensor`, `binary_sensor`, `switch`, etc.) — JS vars like `stat.low`, `x.state`, `arr.map` are reliably rejected
- When entities list is all junk, scan raw HTML for quoted `domain.slug` literals to recover real entity_ids

## 4.1.7 — Smart context battery synonyms + entity pre-filter + Companion App auth
- `intent.py`: IT→EN keyword synonyms + `device_class` search (batterie→battery, temperatura→temperature, umidità→humidity, etc.) — finds all relevant entities, not just those with Italian names
- `tools.py`: pre-filter non-HA strings (JS expressions) from `entities[]` before HA validation
- `tools.py`: `getTokenAsync()` supporting HA Companion App (`externalApp`/`webkit`) with `localStorage` fallback
- `api.py`: improved OAuth provider logging at startup

## 4.1.6 — Fix messaging in chat UI + sort order
- WhatsApp/Telegram sessions no longer appear in the main chat UI conversation list
- Removed "Recent context: USER:..." prefix injected into WhatsApp messages (redundant, polluted saved conversations)
- Messaging list (WhatsApp + Telegram) now sorted with most recent chat first

## 4.1.5 — Smart context larger window + compact entity lists
- `MAX_SMART_CONTEXT` raised from 10 000 to 25 000 chars (5× more sensor data visible per query)
- Entity lists with >20 entries now use compact JSON, saving ~40% token space
- Entity injection capped at 80 entries per query (prevents single-keyword floods like "temperature" from eating the whole context)
- Fixes WhatsApp temperature queries returning only 4 out of 48 available sensors

## 4.1.4 — Add enable_mcp toggle
- Added `enable_mcp` option (default `false`) to disable MCP at startup
- When disabled, MCP servers are never contacted and no connection errors appear in logs
- New toggle visible in Home Assistant addon config UI (all 4 languages: IT, EN, FR, ES)

## 4.1.3 — Complete BoBot → Amira rename
- **CHANGE**: Renamed all remaining `BoBot`/`bobot` references to `Amira`/`amira` in `config.yaml` (panel title, port description, MCP config path)

## 4.1.2 — Rename addon to Amira
- **CHANGE**: Addon renamed from `BoBot` to `Amira` in Home Assistant addon store (`name` and `description` in `config.yaml`)

## 4.1.1 — Dockerfile fixes + new modules
- **FIX**: Corrected Dockerfile `COPY` instructions — removed non-existent `memory_system.py` reference
- **NEW**: Added `scheduled_tasks.py` to the Docker image (task scheduler module)
- **NEW**: Added `voice_transcription.py` to the Docker image (voice/TTS module)
- **FIX**: Removed duplicate `COPY memory.py` instruction in Dockerfile

## 4.1.0 — Complete provider architecture rewrite + dashboard intelligence
> **Breaking change from v3.x** — provider system completely rewritten

### Provider system
- Replaced monolithic `providers_anthropic/google/openai.py` with the modular `providers/` package
- 22 provider classes: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Mistral, NVIDIA, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama, GitHub, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Web, OpenAI Codex, Zhipu, SiliconFlow, Moonshot, MiniMax, AiHubMix, VolcEngine, DashScope, Perplexity, Custom
- Provider manager with unified streaming interface and enhanced error handling
- Dynamic model list: `PROVIDER_MODELS` built from each provider's `get_available_models()` at startup — single source of truth
- `model_fetcher.py`: live model refresh from official APIs with on-disk cache
- `rate_limiter.py`, `error_handler.py`, `tool_simulator.py`: shared utilities across providers

### OpenAI Codex provider
- OAuth PKCE flow: token stored at `/data/oauth_codex.json` with auto-refresh
- Correct model list (gpt-5.x-codex only)
- Connected banner in UI showing account ID, expiry and disconnect button
- `/api/oauth/codex/revoke` endpoint

### HTML Dashboard
- **Smart context split**: `[CURRENT_DASHBOARD_HTML]` injected as a separate conversation turn to avoid token overflow while keeping the full entity context (10KB cap)
- **Intent detection**: filesystem lookup in `www/dashboards/` to correctly route requests to `create_html_dashboard`
- `openMoreInfo()` with native `hass-more-info` event + custom modal fallback
- Auth redirect: if token is missing, redirect to `/?redirect=...`
- Sidebar title always prefixed with `Amira — <title>` (enforced in `tools.py`)

### Chat UI & bubble
- `stripContextInjections()`: hides `[CONTEXT:...]` and `[CURRENT_DASHBOARD_HTML]` blocks from the displayed conversation history without affecting stored data
- Tool call artifacts hidden from conversation history (`api_conversation_get`)
- Bubble drag fixed with Pointer Events API + `setPointerCapture()`
- Removed outdated "Novita v3.0" vision feature strings across all 4 languages

### New features
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol server support
- **Telegram & WhatsApp**: bot integration
- **Voice transcription**: Whisper STT and TTS support
- **Semantic cache**: reduces API calls via semantic response caching
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation on local files
- **File upload**: attach files to conversations
- **Memory**: two-layer memory system with `MEMORY.md` (long-term facts) and `HISTORY.md` (session log)
- **Scheduled tasks**: task scheduler with autonomous agent
- **Quality metrics**: response quality scoring
- **Prompt caching**: prompt caching to reduce Anthropic API costs
- **Image support**: multi-provider image analysis
- **GitHub Copilot**: dedicated OAuth provider
